# **D&D Character Creater Buddy!!**
### *Helping newbies to make adventure-ready characters of all shapes and sizes :D*


## **About:**
### If you've ever been a D&D newb, then you can sympathize with how much work goes into making your first character. Simply amassing enough knowledge to fill in every required field takes effort, let alone min/maxing and creating a succinct personality/background. The goal of this app is to enable anybody's grandma to easily create their first fictional, battle-ready adventurer.


## **Core Goals:**
### I. Construct a form that uses an API and user input to transfer information to a character sheet.
### II. Present useful information at the most relevant times to enable the user to make informed decisions on shaping their character.
### III. Design a page that is both visually appealing, functionally sound, and explicitly clear in directing the user's interaction.
### IV. Allow the user to print their character sheet once completed.

## **Stretch Goals:**
### I. Create Users that have the ability to save and edit characters.
### II. Build a forum where users can discuss topics of the game.
### III. Use Google Maps API to help users find D&D matches near them.
### IV. Build a Form for Dungeon Masters that helps them build maps and plots for their players.


## **User Stories**
### *Bobby*  is a grandmother who was born in a time where they, unfortunately, still named girls Bobby. She has always loved fiction, and playing board games. Her grandson Petey just told her about this D&D business and she is intrigued. She wants to play, but she cant figure out where to start. There is too much information out there, and she doesn't know what the hell a Tiefling is. Why the hell would she want to be born of a dragon? Do they moisturize? She stumbles upon my awesome website, and before she knows it, she has printed off a sleek looking document with all the information she needs. "Your telling me that I can play a magical lute to heal friends and slay foes. Shveet! Thank You Adventure Buddy"

### *Susan*  is a boy who never lived in a time where this was a good name for a boy, however, with his mother's name being Butch, his grandmother's name being Bobby, and no father in the picture, I guess that's just the way the Shtick is. Unlike the song by Johnny Cash, Susan didn't grow up to be tough. Instead he just plays so much D&D he forgot about the girls who laugh at him. Problem is, Susan has so many characters he cant keep track. And with each of these fictional instances forming a tiny piece of his identity, he cant afford to lose them or have their papers be ruined by the weight of time. Instead, Susan goes digital, and his forum name is "Bullets Whiskey Muscle Car".
